// Package wui provides a Renderable abstraction for manipulating the html dom. It provides three base building
// blocks: Node, Modifier and Component. A Node allocates dom elements, a Modifier changes it by either
// modifying attributes are using other Node instances to append elements or a Component which returns a Node
// to allocate and modify an Element but also connects it with a lifecycle, as long as it is alive. Detaching
// an Element will release it (mostly listeners connected to a Component). Subsequent Component.Render calls
// will allocate another Element and attach until released (and/or re-rendered).
